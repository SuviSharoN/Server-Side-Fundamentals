      <p>
        Server-side engineering is what happens behind the scenes when you use a website or an app. It's the "backstage" work that makes the "onstage" user experience possible.
      </p>
      <p className="metaphor">
        Think of it like a restaurant. You (the <strong>client</strong>) order from a waiter. The waiter (the <strong>API</strong>) takes your order to the kitchen (the <strong>server</strong>), which prepares your food (the <strong>data</strong>). You don't see the kitchen, but it's essential for your meal.
